                         <p>Hello! My name is Asa Stallworth. 
                            I'm a web developer that is at your service!</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>A little bit about me: I'm currently 20 years old, soon to be 21 in Febuary. I enjoy 
                                listing to music as well as playing Play Station and of course, web development. I was a competitve swimmer 
                                for 14 years including having  a scholarship to swim at Davis and Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia freshman year.
                                I'm from South Carolina, I love watching Atlanta Braves as well as going to Carolina Panther football
                                games up in Charlotte.</p>

                        <p>In the fall of 2016 I started teaching myself Web development. I started out building a website just to see my skills for my father's small business.
                            Pretty soon after talking to him he said "Hey how about we make this website live?" From there I rebuilt the website from scratch putting my basic skills
                            of HTML, and CSS. After a while I grew to resent that website and how it looked. It wasn't responsive, it looked like it came stright out of the 1990's.
                            I decided to scrap it and compeletly rebuild. I had gained more skills than before so I started out rebuilding using Bootstrap 4. Since I restarted I have been using 
                            a website called <a id="timecampLink" href="www.timecamp.com">Timecamp.com</a> to track my hours. With over 100 hours put into this new website I built my confidence up.
                            Pretty soon, we'll have the website up!</p>
